# Open Sign

Open Sign is a small NodeJS application that displays pixel art on a LED matrix.

The hardware required is:

* Raspberry Pi - *probably best with at least a Raspberry Pi 3 Model B Rev 1.2*
* An RGB LED Matrix HAT for Raspberry Pi - *I use the [RGB Matrix HAT + RTC](https://www.adafruit.com/product/2345) from Adafruit, or [you can wire it up yourself](https://github.com/hzeller/rpi-rgb-led-matrix/blob/master/wiring.md)*
* An RGB LED Matrix board - *I use [this 64x32 pixel matrix](https://www.adafruit.com/product/2277) from Adafruit, but any board that complies with the [RPI RGB LED Matrix library limitations](https://github.com/hzeller/rpi-rgb-led-matrix) should work - note: that currently only one board at a time is supported or tested, so no chaining of boards (adding support should be pretty trivial, but I don't have a second board to test this)*
* A USB mouse to control the display - *use a two button mouse with a scrollwheel to get the maximum functionality*

## Installation

The application requires NodeJS v18, and setup on the Raspberry Pi can be a bit tricky.

Assuming you have Raspian installed on your Raspberry Pi, you'll need to make sure that your RGB LED Matrix HAT is installed properly and working - this could include messing around with `raspi-config` settings, check the instructions for your particular HAT.

Once things are wired up and you are confident that your Pi, HAT, and LED matrix are working, you can start installingâ€¦

Go to the `pi` user home directory and make a new directory for the application with write permission open to anyone:

```sh
cd /home/pi
mkdir open-sign
chmod 777 open-sign
```

Get a copy of this code into that new directory, it's generally a good idea to clone the Git repository:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/sambauers/open-sign.git open-sign
```

Install NVM for the `pi` user using [their instructions](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm).

Once done install NodeJS 18 and make it the default:

```sh
nvm install lts/hydrogen
nvm alias default lts/hydrogen
nvm use default
```

Now update `npm` and `corepack`, and install `pnpm`:

```sh
npm -g install npm
npm -g install corepack
npm -g install pnpm
```

Now go into the application directory and install dependencies (this will take a while):

```sh
cd open-sign
pnpm install
```

Since accessing the LED Matrix hardware requires root privileges, we need to actually launch the application as `root`, so you'll need to repeat some of the steps as `root`, switch to the `root` user using `sudo`:

```sh
sudo -s
```

Make sure you are in the correct directory since you switched to root:

```sh
cd /home/pi/open-sign
```

Install NVM for the `root` user using [their instructions](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm).

Once done install NodeJS 18 again for `root` and make it the default:

```sh
nvm install lts/hydrogen
nvm alias default lts/hydrogen
nvm use default
```

Now update `npm` and `corepack`, and install `pnpm`:

```sh
npm -g install npm
npm -g install corepack
npm -g install pnpm
```

Additionally, install `pm2`:

```sh
npm -g install pm2
```

## Configuration

Switch back to the `pi` user by `exit` ing from `sudo` and ensure you are in the correct directory:

```sh
exit
cd /home/pi/open-sign
```

Now open `ecosystem.config.js` and adjust the environment variables `LED_HEIGHT` and `LED_WIDTH` as needed.

## Build

Remaining as the `pi` user, ensure the correct Node version is being used and build the application:

```sh
nvm use
pnpm build
```

The compiled application should now be in the `dist` directory.

## First run

Switch back to the `root` user and ensure you are in the correct directory:

```sh
sudo -s
cd /home/pi/open-sign
```

Ensure the correct Node version is being used, and then start the application using `pm2`:

```sh
nvm use
pm2 start ecosystem.config.js --env production
```

The application will start on a blank screen. Click the left mouse button to display the first image on the RGB LED matrix.

## Controls

* Left mouse button - go to next image
* Right mouse button - go to previous image
* Scrollwheel up - increase brightness
* Scrollwheel down - decrease brightness

## Starting on boot

To start the sign automatically on boot, you can use PM2's built-in startup
script generator.

Switch to root and run the `pm2 startup` command:

```sh
sudo -s
pm2 startup
```

Most times it will install the startup script for you, but check the PM2
documentation if you get stuck.

Ensure you are in the correct directory, and ensure the application is started:

```sh
cd /home/pi/open-sign
pm2 start ecosystem.config.js --env production
```

Then simply "save" the list of running PM2 services to ensure they start on
boot:

```sh
pm2 save
```

The sign should now launch automatically on boot.

## Setting up run schedules

You may want to start and stop the sign at certain times of the day or week. This can be achieved by configuring `crontab`.

The simplest version of this starts and stops the application by sending signals to `pm2`.

You can edit `root`'s `crontab` file by running:

```sh
sudo crotab -e
```

Then setup start and stop actions like:

```sh
# Ensure pm2 can be found on your PATH - adjust as
# neccesary depending on your NVM/NPM binaries path
PATH=$PATH:/root/.nvm/versions/node/v18.17.1/bin

# Turn the sign on at 8:30 AM, Monday to Friday
30 8 * * 1-5 pm2 sendSignal SIGUSR1 open-sign

# Turn the sign off at 4:30 PM, Monday to Friday
30 16 * * 1-5 pm2 sendSignal SIGUSR2 open-sign

# In case of power failure and reboot outside these hours, turn off the sign every 15 minutes outside those hours

# Monday to Friday before 8:30 AM
*/15 0-7 * * 1-5 pm2 sendSignal SIGUSR2 open-sign
0-25/15 8 * * 1-5 pm2 sendSignal SIGUSR2 open-sign

# Monday to Friday after 4:30 PM
35-55/15 16 * * 1-5 pm2 sendSignal SIGUSR2 open-sign
*/15 17-23 * * 1-5 pm2 sendSignal SIGUSR2 open-sign

# Saturday and Sunday
*/15 * * * 6 pm2 sendSignal SIGUSR2 open-sign
*/15 * * * 0 pm2 sendSignal SIGUSR2 open-sign
```

You may need to restart the `cron` service after editing:

```sh
/etc/init.d/cron restart
```

## Adding more images

Adding more images is easy.

Simply create new images in `PNG` format at the correct dimensions for your LED matrix and drop them into the `moods` directory.

The images are loaded in alphabetical order. You can force the order of the images by utilising a number prefix. See the file names in the `moods` directory for an example of this.

The images in the moods diroctory that come with the application are 64x32 pixels.

Transparent PNGs are supported (the transparency is treated as black).

If you add new images, they won't be registered by the application until you restart the application.

```sh
sudo -s
cd /home/pi/open-sign
nvm use
pm2 restart ecosystem.config.js --env production
```
